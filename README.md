## 🚀 How It Works

### Password Evaluation Criteria
The application uses a sophisticated scoring system that evaluates:

1. **Length Analysis**
   - 8+ characters: Basic security
   - 12+ characters: Recommended length
   - Longer passwords receive higher scores

2. **Character Variety**
   - Lowercase letters (a-z)
   - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
   - Numbers (0-9)
   - Special characters (!@#$%^&*)

3. **Security Patterns**
   - ❌ Common passwords (password, 123456, etc.)
   - ❌ Sequential characters (abc, 123)
   - ❌ Repetitive patterns (aaa, 111)
   - ❌ Dictionary words

### Strength Levels

| Level         | Score | Description        | Color            |
|---------------|-------|--------------------|------------------|
| **Very Weak** | 0-1   | Easily guessable   | 🔴 Red           |
| **Weak**      | 2     | Basic patterns     | 🟠 Orange        |
| **Medium**    | 3-4   | Decent security    | 🟡 Yellow        |
| **Strong**    | 5     | Good security      | 🟢 Green         |
| **Very Strong**| 6+   | Excellent security | 🟢 Dark Green    |
